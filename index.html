            DANAE is a direct detection experiment, currently under development.
            The DANAE experiment was designed in collaboration with the HLL
            (semiconductor Laboratory of the Max Planck Society) and uses special, low-noise
            silicon detectors with single-electron resolution to study the scattering
            of dark matter particles off valence-band electrons in the semiconductor.

    <p>
      The goal of the DANAE experiment is the direct detection of dark matter (DM) with particle masses below 1 GeV/c².
      This so-called light dark matter has gained increasing attention in recent years, driven by theoretical model predictions
      as well as by the experimental exclusion of higher-mass regions. The DANAE experiment therefore employs special silicon
      detectors—DEPFETs (Deep p-channel Field Effect Transistors) with repetitive non-destructive readout (RNDR).
    </p>

    <p>
      Within an RNDR-DEPFET pixel, the signal charge is repeatedly shifted between two readout nodes and measured until a noise
      level below 0.2 electrons (e⁻ ENC, equivalent noise charge) is achieved. This enables the detection of single electrons
      with a significance of five standard deviations. To efficiently suppress background events, the sensors consist of
      several thousand such pixels and feature readout times below 5 ms per pixel.
    </p>

    <p>
      In contrast to other established dark matter experiments, the DANAE experiment investigates the scattering of DM
      particles off electrons rather than off atomic nuclei. Since significantly less energy is required to excite an
      electron, this approach allows for enhanced sensitivity to low-mass dark matter.
    </p>

    <p>
      Astronomical observations constrain the local dark matter density in the solar system, implying that lower-mass DM
      particles occur more frequently. As a result, only a few kilograms of sensitive detector material are sufficient to
      explore previously inaccessible mass regions.
    </p>

    <p>
      The DANAE project is currently in the phase of technology development and scaling. Using a first prototype detector with
      a 64 × 64 pixel matrix, the operating principle has been successfully demonstrated. Further optimization of the
      technology, as well as detailed studies and reduction of background contributions, are required before increasing the
      sensitive mass and commencing scientific data taking.
    </p>

    <p>
      The project is carried out in collaboration with the semiconductor Laboratory of the Max Planck Society (HLL) and the
      Department of Aerospace Engineering at the University of Applied Sciences Wiener Neustadt (FHWN).
