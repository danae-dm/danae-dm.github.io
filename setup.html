      <h2>Location of DANAE</h2>

      <p>
        The current prototype of DANAE is located in Vienna, Austria, at an altitude of about
        190 m above sea level, on the ground floor of the laboratory building.
        The detector is operated inside a vacuum chamber at a pressure of approximately
        5×10⁻⁶ mbar (5×10⁻⁴ Pa) and is surrounded by thermal shielding.
      </p>

      <p>
        The building provides passive shielding: the roof and floors correspond to about
        1.2 m of concrete. In addition, the vacuum chamber contributes roughly
        1 cm of stainless steel and the thermal shielding about
        5 cm of aluminium. These layers are relevant for estimating the expected
        environmental background.

      <h2>What are RNDR DePFETs?</h2>

      <p>
        A DePFET (<u>de</u>pleted <u>p</u>-channel <u>f</u>ield-<u>e</u>ffect <u>t</u>ransistor)
        is a fully depleted silicon pixel sensor with an integrated charge collection and
        storage node and an in-pixel first-stage amplification. In contrast to CCDs, which
        transfer charge to a common readout node, a DePFET provides a dedicated readout
        transistor in each pixel (active pixel concept).
      </p>

      <p>
        An RNDR-DePFET enables <u>r</u>epetitive <u>n</u>on-<u>d</u>estructive
        <u>r</u>eadout (RNDR) by moving charge between two internal storage nodes (sub-pixels)
        using a transfer gate. The collected electrons modulate the channel conductivity and
        thereby the drain current. Charge can be removed via the clear contact in combination
        with a clear gate (see Fig. 1).
      </p>

      <figure class="figure-right">

        <figcaption>
          RNDR-DEPFET schematic: Electrons are collected in the internal gate to modify the
          conductivity of the transistor channel. An RNDR-DePFET pixel hosts two sub-pixels
          to interchange electrons for repetitive readout [1].
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        Charge generated in the depleted silicon bulk drifts towards the internal gates.
        Using the transfer gate, the charge is first stored in one node, e.g. gate 1 and
        read out. The charge is then moved to gate 2, and gate 1 is read out again to obtain
        an updated baseline, which is subtracted from the first measurement. The procedure
        is repeated analogously for gate 2.
      </p>

      <p>
        By moving the same charges back and forth, the signal can be measured N times without
        destroying the charge. Averaging reduces the readout noise approximately as
        1/√N, which is reflected by the narrowing of the noise peak in Fig. 2.

          smaller for a larger number of repetitions. This leads to better separation between
          the peaks corresponding to the number of electrons.

      <h2>Dark matter detection</h2>

      <p>
        In direct detection experiments, energy depositions in a target material can be
        observed via different experimental channels, most commonly scintillation light,
        phonons (heat), and ionization charge (see Fig. 3). DANAE uses the ionization channel:
        a dark matter particle may scatter off an electron and transfer enough energy to
        promote it into the conduction band of silicon, producing a measurable charge signal.
      </p>

      <p>
        To suppress thermally generated charge carriers (dark current), the detector is
        cooled to about 140 K.
      </p>

      <figure class="figure-right">
        <img src="/images/DetectionChannels.png" alt="Detection channels" width="400">
        <figcaption>
          The three channels are shown. Scintillation results in light being emitted, nuclear
          recoil resulting in phonons, heating the target, and electro recoil resulting in
          ionization and charges being created. DANAE uses the ionization channel.

    <section id="setup">
      <h2>The setup</h2>

      <p>
        The setup consists of a vacuum chamber (see Fig. 4) operated at a pressure of about
        5×10⁻⁶ mbar. Most electronics are placed outside the chamber to reduce thermal load
        and electromagnetic interference. The DePFET control and front-end readout
        electronics, however, are located inside the vacuum to keep cable lengths short and
        to minimize capacitive pickup and noise.
      </p>

      </figure>

      <p>
        The sensor comprises a 64×64 matrix of RNDR-DePFET pixels. Rows are read out
        sequentially while the pixels within a row are read out in parallel. With 800
        repetitions per pixel, a full sensor frame is acquired in about 1.2 s (left panel of
        Fig. 5).
      </p>

      <p>
        The sensor thickness is 450 μm, and each pixel has a side length of 50 μm.
        As shown in the right panel of Fig. 5, two sub-pixels form an elongated, oval-like
        structure.
